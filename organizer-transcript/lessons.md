# Lessons Learned

## 2026-02-10 | Conference vs Earnings Call separation: The indexer now categorizes 12+ event types (Conference, Investor Day, M&A Call, Business Update, etc.) and extracts event_name from filename. The browser UI separates earnings calls from conferences in distinct sections (conferences collapsed by default). Backend uses typed labels (event_type|Q# YYYY) to prevent conferences from contaminating earnings analysis. Legacy quarter-only labels only match Earnings Call type.

## 2026-02-11 | Peer comparison first run (GOOG vs META vs AMZN Q4 2025): Successfully generated 6-section cross-company analysis using prompt_peer.py template. Key workflow: parse tickers → find transcript PDFs in Downloads/Earnings Transcripts/{Company} folders → read all PDFs → generate analysis with page citations → save to _Peer Comparisons/ folder via save_peer_analysis(). Context window pressure: 3 transcripts (~58 pages) consumed significant context — consider summarizing before analysis for 4-company comparisons.

## 2026-02-11 | Peer prompt v1→v2 redesign (session 39a22c00e0f4): User feedback: v1 was too "financial-table-driven". PM wants competitive intelligence, not financial statement comparison. Key shift: (1) §2 "管理层竞争叙事对比" becomes core section (25-30% of report) with 一致/分歧/为什么不一致 structure per topic (2) Management tone annotation (自信/谨慎/回避/激进) + source context (prepared remarks vs Q&A) (3) Analyst push-back & response quality tracking (4) §1 now identifies competitive domains first, then compares within each domain (5) New §5 Strategic Divergence with trend extrapolation. Page citation format simplified to (TICKER p.X). Word count raised to 5000-10000 for deeper analysis.
